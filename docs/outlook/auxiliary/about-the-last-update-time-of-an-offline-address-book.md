To find the last update time of an OAB, solutions can use the following entry in the Windows registry: **HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider\OAB Last Modified Time**. The type of this registry entry is **REG_BINARY**. The data is 8 bytes in size. You can convert the data to a 64-bit [FILETIME](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9baf8a0e-59e3-4fbd-9616-2ec9161520d1%28Office.15%29.aspx) structure specifying a Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) value that Outlook last downloaded the OAB files from the Exchange server to the client computer.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="0c7c1-p103">Outlook solutions that want to provide their users offline access to an OAB may need to find out when the OAB was last updated from the Exchange server.
