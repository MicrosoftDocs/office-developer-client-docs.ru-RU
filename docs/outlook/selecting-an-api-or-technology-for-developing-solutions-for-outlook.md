<span data-ttu-id="a87fc-p105">Starting in Office 2013, developers can use the Надстройки Office platform to extend web services and content into the context of Office rich and web clients. An Надстройка Office is a web page that is developed using common web technologies, hosted inside an Office client application (such as Outlook), and can run on-premises or in the cloud. Of the few types of Надстройки Office, the type that Outlook supports is called mail apps. While the object model, PIA, and MAPI are often used to automate Outlook at an application level, you can use the JavaScript API for Office to interact at an item level with the content and properties of an email message, meeting request, or appointment. You can publish mail apps to the Магазин Office or an internal Exchange catalog.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a87fc-p105">Starting in Office 2013, developers can use the Office Add-ins platform to extend web services and content into the context of Office rich and web clients.
